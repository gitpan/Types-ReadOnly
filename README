NAME
    Types::ReadOnly - type constraints and coercions for read-only data
    structures and locked hashes

SYNOPSIS
       has foo => (is => 'ro', isa => ReadOnly[ArrayRef], coerce => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a type constraint library for write-restricted references.

    This module is built with Type::Tiny, which means that you can use it with
    Moo, Mouse, Moose, or none of the above.

  Type Constraints
    This library provides the following type constraints:

    `ReadOnly`
        A type constraint for references to read-only scalars, arrays and
        hashes. Values don't necessarily need to be deeply read-only to pass
        the type check.

        This type constraint *only works when it is parameterized*.

        This type constraint inherits coercions from its parameter, and makes
        the result read-only (deeply).

    `Locked`
        A type constraint for hashrefs with locked keys (see Hash::Util).

        This type constraint *only works when it is parameterized with
        `HashRef` or a hashref-like type constraint*. For example
        `Locked[HashRef]` or `Locked[ Map[ IpAddr, HostName ] ]`.

        When parameterized with a `Dict` type constraint (see
        Types::Standard), it will use the `Dict` type as the authoritative
        list of keys that the hashref should be locked with.

        This type constraint inherits coercions from its parameter, and
        applies `lock_ref_keys` to the result.
